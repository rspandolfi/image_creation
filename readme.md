To make a standard CA pi image simply install Raspbian Jessie using NOOBS (currently 1.9.2) as described [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/noobs.md).

Once Raspbian has been installed hook the pi up to a display, configure the desired network, then clone this repository using:

After cloning the repository, navigate to the `raspberry_pi` directory and run the desired setup script.
